    This is our first HTML website. In this website we have implemented all that we have learned in this course.<br/>
    HTML or HyperText Markup Language is markup language that we use for creating HTML documents that web browsers <br/>
    (Google Chrome, Internet Explorer etc.) will convert to web pages. <br/><br/>
                    
    HTML is not a <mark>programming language</mark>, it is Markup Language so you will not use it to do some data processing <br/>
    or anything like that, you will use HTML for to creating just visual representation of your website.<br/><br/>
                    
    Every HTML document contains HTML tags and HTML elements. Every single element of your website (text, button, image) <br/>
    is HTML element or HTML tag.<br/><br/>
   
  
    This is an empty or self closing HTML element: <selfClosingElement/><br/><br/>
                    
    Every website on internet is written in HTML. HTML is designed in the early 90's and from then until now it is starting <br/>
    point for learning web development. So congratulations on making your first step and enjoy! <br/><br/>
